Proc app: I have v 2.0.3 = latest that runs on X.6.8
~/lib/pref/proc/prefs.txt has most font and styles
Proc.app/cont/reso/java/lib/theme.txt has color, text sizes
Proc Getting Started errata: oreilly.com/catalog/0639620000570.do

Add Library gets you contributed lib's, makes contrib.txt file in ~/Lib/Proc/
that makes Proc hog CPU badly; delete it. may be OK on iMac+Proc2

noLoop() in setup or draw runs draw loop once, then stops, leaves window open

exit() stops draw loop, quits app, window closes; 
if (mousePressed == true){exit()} Quits app

delay(mS) works at start of draw to pause; redraw occurs when draw finishes

do{some stuff once or more?} while(this is true) -- seems OK in Proc, but limited use as both block key entry or window draw ops; maybe useful to calculate, or fill array from incoming data ?

translate(x,y) sets drawing origin (0,0) to x,y  GS p. 106-8

Sys.out.printf("stuff%04.2f", flt/dub)
